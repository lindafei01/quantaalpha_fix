potential_direction_transformation: |-
  It's the first round, the user provided a potential direction: "{{ potential_direction }}". Referring to it, you need to transform it into a hypothesis in formal language that is clear and actionable for factor generation. Consider the following aspects while formulating the hypothesis:
  1. **Clarity**: Ensure the hypothesis is specific and unambiguous.
  2. **Actionability**: The hypothesis should suggest a clear path for experimentation or investigation.
  3. **Relevance**: Ensure the hypothesis is directly related to the potential direction provided by the user.

    Please understand the following operation logic and then make your feedback that is suitable for the scenario:

    {{ scenario }}

    You will receive a hypothesis, multiple tasks with their factors, their results, and the SOTA result. 
    Your feedback should specify whether the current result supports or refutes the hypothesis, compare it with previous SOTA (State of the Art) results, and suggest improvements or new directions.
    Please understand the following operation logic and then make your feedback that is suitable for the scenario:
      1. Logic Explanation:
          - Each hypothesis represents a theoretical framework that can be refined through multiple iterations
          - Focus on exploring various implementations within the same theoretical framework
          - Continuously optimize factor construction methods before considering direction changes
      
      2. Development Directions:
          - Hypothesis Refinement:
              - Suggest specific improvements in factor construction methodology
              - Propose alternative mathematical representations of the same theoretical concept
              - Identify potential variations in parameter selection and combination methods
          
          - Factor Enhancement:
              - Fine-tune existing factors through parameter or structure optimization
              - Explore different normalization and standardization approaches
              - Consider alternative window sizes and weighting schemes
          
          - Methodological Iteration:
              - Refine the mathematical expression while maintaining the core concept
              - Suggest complementary signals within the same theoretical framework
              - Propose robust variations of the current methodology
      
      3. Final Goal:
          - The ultimate goal is to continuously mine factors that surpass each iteration to maintain the best SOTA.
    
      When analyzing results:
      1. **Factor Construction Analysis:**
          - Evaluate how different construction methods affect factor performance
          - Identify which aspects of the construction process contribute most to performance
          - Suggest specific modifications to improve factor robustness
      
      2. **Parameter Sensitivity:**
          - Analyze the impact of different parameter choices
          - Recommend parameter ranges for further exploration
          - Identify critical components in the factor construction process

      3. **Complexity Control (CRITICAL - PRIMARY CAUSE OF POOR TEST PERFORMANCE):**
          - **Symbol Length (SL)**: Factors with expressions exceeding 250 characters are HIGHLY LIKELY to be OVERFITTING. If a factor is flagged for high symbol length, it MUST be drastically simplified in the next iteration. Target: 50-150 characters.
          - **Base Features Count (ER)**: Factors using too many distinct raw features (> 6) indicate over-engineering. Recommend reducing to 2-4 core features.
          - **Free Parameters (PC)**: Factors with too many free parameters (numeric constants) relative to total nodes (> 50%) are likely over-parameterized. Reduce parameter count significantly.
          - **OVERFITTING WARNING**: Complex factors with long expressions, many nested functions, and conditional branches almost ALWAYS perform well on training/validation but FAIL CATASTROPHICALLY on test sets. This is the #1 cause of poor out-of-sample performance.
          - **RECOMMENDED ACTION**: When a factor has high training IC but poor test IC, ASSUME it is overfitting due to complexity. Generate a MUCH simpler factor (< 150 characters) that captures the core idea.
          - When complexity feedback is provided, treat it as a CRITICAL ERROR that must be addressed immediately. Do not just slightly modify the factor - generate a fundamentally simpler alternative.

    Focus on Continuous Refinement:
      - Exhaust all possible variations within the current theoretical framework
      - Document the effectiveness of different implementation approaches
      - **Always prioritize simplicity over complexity** - simpler factors that achieve similar or better performance are preferred

    Analyze the combined result in the context of its ability to:
    1. Support or refute the hypothesis.
    2. Show improvement or deterioration compared to the SOTA experiment.

    Evaluation Metrics Explanations:
    Below are the financial meanings of each metric, which should be used to judge the results:

    - 1day.excess_return_without_cost.max_drawdown: Measures the maximum loss from a peak to a trough without considering transaction costs. (the smaller the better)
    - 1day.excess_return_without_cost.information_ratio: Evaluates the excess return per unit of risk without considering transaction costs. (the bigger the better)
    - 1day.excess_return_without_cost.annualized_return: Annualized return without considering transaction costs. (the bigger the better)
    - IC: Measures the correlation between predicted returns (\hat{y}) and actual returns (y), using Pearson correlation. (the bigger the better)

    When judging the results:
      1. **Recommendation for Replacement:**
        - If the new factor shows a significant improvement in the annualized return without transaction costs, recommend it to replace the current best result.
        - If the annualized return and any other single metric are better than SOTA, recommend the replacement.
        - Minor variations in other metrics are acceptable as long as the annualized return improves.
        - **However, if a factor has complexity warnings, be cautious about recommending replacement even if metrics are good, as it may overfit and fail on future data.**
      
      2. **Complexity Considerations:**
        - If complexity feedback is provided for a factor, this is a critical issue that must be addressed.
        - Factors flagged for excessive complexity should be simplified in the next iteration, even if current metrics appear good.
        - Emphasize in your feedback that the factor needs simplification to avoid overfitting and improve generalization.

    Note: Only factors with 'Factor Implementation' as True are implemented and tested in this experiment. If 'Factor Implementation' is False, the hypothesis for that factor cannot be verified in this run.

    The user is trying to generate new {{targets}} based on the hypothesis generated in the previous step. 
    The {{targets}} are used in certain scenario, the scenario is as follows:
    {{ scenario }}

    The user will use the {{targets}} generated to do some experiments. The user will provide this information to you:
    1. The target hypothesis you are targeting to generate {{targets}} for.
    2. The hypothesis generated in the previous steps and their corresponding feedbacks.
    3. Former proposed {{targets}} on similar hypothesis.
    4. Duplicated sub-expressions that you have to evade for better factor originality and novelty. 
    5. Some additional information to help you generate new {{targets}}.


    1. **2-3 Factors per Generation:**
      - Ensure each generation produces 2-3 factors.
      - Balance simplicity and innovation to build a robust factor library.
      - Note that each factor is independent. Please do NOT reference other factors within the factor expression.

    2. **CRITICAL: Factor Complexity Constraints (MUST FOLLOW - OVERFITTING PREVENTION):**
      - **Symbol Length (SL) Limit: ≤ 250 characters (STRICT LIMIT)**
        - Factor expressions MUST NOT exceed 250 characters. This is a HARD LIMIT.
        - **WARNING: Overly complex/long expressions (> 250 chars) are highly prone to OVERFITTING.** They may perform well on training data but fail catastrophically on test data.
        - **Simple factors generalize better.** A concise factor with moderate performance is FAR more valuable than a complex one with high training performance but poor test performance.
        - Example of GOOD (short, ~50 chars): `RANK(TS_MEAN($return, 20))`
        - Example of GOOD (moderate, ~100 chars): `RANK(TS_CORR($close, $volume, 10)) * SIGN(TS_MEAN($return, 5))`
        - Example of BAD (too long, > 250 chars): `RANK(POW(TS_CORR($close, SEQUENCE(15), 15), 2)) * RANK(TS_MEAN(($high - $low) / ($volume + 1e-8), 15)) * ...`
      - **Base Features (ER) Limit: ≤ 6 distinct raw features**
        - Use at most 6 distinct base features (e.g., $close, $open, $high, $low, $volume, $return).
        - Reusing the same feature multiple times is acceptable, but using too many different features indicates over-engineering.
        - Prefer factors that focus on 2-4 core features rather than using all available features.
      - **Simplicity Priority (ANTI-OVERFITTING):**
        - **ALWAYS prioritize simplicity over complexity.** A simple factor that works is FAR better than a complex one.
        - **Complex factors with many nested functions, conditional branches, and parameters are OVERFITTING indicators.**
        - Avoid deep nesting (e.g., RANK(POW(TS_CORR(...))) is too nested)
        - Avoid complex conditional expressions (e.g., (A > B) ? (C * D / E) : (F * G / H))
        - Prefer linear combinations over multiplicative chains
        - Use fewer function calls and simpler operations
        - **Target expression length: 50-150 characters for optimal generalization.**
      - **If previous factors were flagged for complexity, you MUST generate MUCH simpler alternatives in the next iteration.**

    3.**Key Considerations in Factor Construction:**
      - **Data Preprocessing and Standardization:**
          - Avoid using raw prices and volumes directly due to scale differences
          - Use relative changes or standardized data (e.g., RANK(), ZSCORE())
          - Convert prices to returns, e.g. `(DELTA($close, 1)/$close)` instead of price levels
          - Transform volume into relative changes, e.g. `(DELTA($volume, 1)/$volume)`

      - **Time Series Processing:**
          - Consider appropriate sample periods for indicators requiring historical data
          - Choose suitable window sizes for moving averages SMA(), EMA(), WMA()

      - **Normalization and Stability:**
          - Add small constants (e.g., 1e-8) to denominators to prevent division by zero
          - Use TS_ZSCORE() for factor value standardization
          - Consider SIGN() to reduce impact of extreme values
          - Apply MAX(MIN(x, upper), lower) for value truncation

      - **Cross-sectional Treatment:**
          - Apply RANK() or ZSCORE() for cross-sectional comparability
          - Use FILTER() for outlier handling
          - Ensure sufficient window length for correlation calculations

      - **Robustness Considerations:**
          - Validate factor stability across multiple time windows
          - Consider TS_MEDIAN() over TS_MEAN() to reduce outlier impact
          - Apply moving averages to smooth high-frequency variations
  
      - **Flexibility Considerations:**  
          - Allow for a range of values or flexibility when defining factors, rather than imposing strict equality constraints.
          - For example, in expression `(TS_MIN($low, 10) == DELAY(TS_MIN($low, 10), 1))`, `==` is too restrictive. 
          - Instead, use a range-based approach like: `(TS_MIN($low, 10) < DELAY(TS_MIN($low, 10), 1) + 1/10 * TS_STD($low, 20)) && (TS_MIN($low, 10) > DELAY(TS_MIN($low, 10), 1) - 1/10 * TS_STD($low, 20))`.

      - **Handling Duplicated Sub-expressions:**
            - When given specific duplicated sub-expressions to avoid, ensure new factor expressions use alternative calculations
            - Replace duplicated patterns with semantically similar but structurally different expressions
            - For example, if `ABS($close - $open)` is flagged as duplicated:
                - Consider using `($high - $low)` for price range
                - Use `SIGN($close - $open) * ($close - $open)` for directional magnitude
                - Explore other price difference combinations like `($high - $low) / ($open + $close)`
            - Maintain factor interpretability while avoiding structural repetition
            - Focus on unique combinations of operators and variables to ensure originality

    When constructing factor expressions, you are restricted to utilizing only the following daily-level variable:
    - $open: open price of the stock on that day.
    - $close: close price of the stock on that day.
    - $high: high price of the stock on that day.
    - $low: low price of the stock on that day.
    - $volume: volume of the stock on that day.
    - $return: daily return of the stock on that day.

    {% if expression_duplication %}
    **Alert: Duplication Detected in Previous Factor Expressions**
    {{ expression_duplication }}

    Recommendations:
    - Avoid the duplicated sub-expressions above
    - Generate novel factor by uniquely combining data variables and operations
    - Experiment with a mix of mathematical operations (e.g., exponentiation, logarithmic transformations) to construct expressions that reveal different relationships and interactions among variables.
    - Replace raw variables with transformed variants to enhance expressiveness, such as using `$open`, `$close/TS_MEAN($close, 10)`, or `($open + $close) / 2` instead of `$close` to normalize or adjust for trends.

  {% if symbol_length > symbol_length_threshold %}
  - **Symbol Length (SL) Check FAILED: Expression length ({{ symbol_length }}) exceeds HARD LIMIT ({{ symbol_length_threshold }} characters)**
    - **🚨 OVERFITTING ALERT**: This factor expression is TOO COMPLEX and will almost certainly OVERFIT.
    - **Root Cause**: Complex expressions with many nested functions, conditional branches, and parameters fit noise in training data rather than true market patterns.
    - **Action Required**: Generate a FUNDAMENTALLY SIMPLER expression. Do NOT just remove a few characters - redesign the factor from scratch.
    - **Target Length**: 50-150 characters for optimal generalization. Anything over 200 is suspicious.
    - **Example of GOOD** (~50 chars): `RANK(TS_MEAN($return, 20))`
    - **Example of ACCEPTABLE** (~100 chars): `RANK(TS_CORR($close, $volume, 10)) * SIGN(TS_MEAN($return, 5))`
    - **Example of BAD** (> 200 chars): Any expression with multiple nested functions, complex conditionals, or many arithmetic operations.
    - **REMEMBER**: A simple factor with IC=0.03 that generalizes is FAR more valuable than a complex factor with IC=0.06 that overfits.

  {% if num_base_features > base_features_threshold %}
  - **Base Features Count (ER) Check Failed: Number of base features ({{ num_base_features }}) exceeds threshold ({{ base_features_threshold }})**
    - **CRITICAL**: The factor uses too many distinct raw features (e.g., $close, $open, $high, $low, $volume, $return).
    - **Action Required**: Reduce the number of distinct base features used. Focus on 2-4 core features instead of using all available features.
    - Target: Use at most {{ base_features_threshold }} distinct base features. Reusing the same feature multiple times is acceptable.
